[00:04.75]Part ¢ò Listening Comprehension
[00:09.17]Section A
[00:10.52]Directions: In this section, 
[00:12.91]you will hear two long conversations. 
[00:15.27]At the end of each conversation, 
[00:17.04]you will hear four questions. 
[00:19.13]Both the conversation and the questions 
[00:21.76]will be spoken only once. 
[00:24.16]After you hear a question, 
[00:25.92]you must choose the best answer 
[00:27.67]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[00:33.12]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[00:35.79]on Answer Sheet 1 
[00:37.72]with a single line through the centre.
[00:41.55]Conversation One
[00:43.60]W: You are going to give 
[00:44.51]a short speech of thanks 
[00:46.03]for the speaker this evening, 
[00:47.36]aren¡¯t you, Bill?
[00:48.51]M: Yes.
[00:49.71]W: You don¡¯t sound very enthusiastic. 
[00:52.08]It¡¯s not that bad, is it?
[00:53.96]M: No. I don¡¯t mind, really. 
[00:56.10]But I can never forget 
[00:57.51]the first speech of thanks I did.
[00:59.50]W: Why? What happened?
[01:00.95]M: Well, I was in my early twenties. 
[01:03.72]I joined the local history society.
[01:05.77]W: Yes?
[01:06.52]M: Anyway, 
[01:07.52]I went along to a lecture by a Miss Bligh.
[01:10.33]W: Oh. Do go on.
[01:11.90]M: She was going to talk with slides 
[01:13.92]about our town in the mid-18th century. 
[01:16.68]She had just published a book on the subject 
[01:19.04]which was reckoned to be quite good. 
[01:21.41]So I went along. 
[01:23.66]When I arrived, the secretary asked me 
[01:26.15]if I could give the speech of thanks.
[01:28.28]Rather stupidly, I said yes.
[01:31.11]W: We¡¯ve all done it.
[01:32.95]M: Anyway, from that point on, 
[01:35.07]I was scared. What should I say? 
[01:38.06]I decided to make notes during the lecture, 
[01:40.70]and refer to interesting parts 
[01:42.67]and thank her on behalf of the society. 
[01:45.38]In fact, 
[01:46.28]by the time Miss Bligh stood up to talk, 
[01:48.70]I was feeling much better. 
[01:50.79]But she was so nervous 
[01:52.05]that she kept forgetting what to say,
[01:54.54]and she spoke almost in a whisper. 
[01:57.30]People at the back kept calling out 
[01:59.55]¡°We can¡¯t hear.¡± 
[02:01.18]It was embarrassing!
[02:02.37]W: I can imagine it.
[02:04.03]M: At least the slides were good, 
[02:05.61]that is, until the bulb in the projector blew. 
[02:09.43]And she had to finish her talk 
[02:10.56]with no illustrations.
[02:11.86]W: So what did you say 
[02:12.70]in your speech of thanks?
[02:15.00]M: What can you say? 
[02:16.33]You have to be polite. 
[02:18.46]I mentioned the interesting facts, 
[02:20.66]referred to the excellent slides, 
[02:22.69]and then finished by saying 
[02:24.29]¡°We¡¯d all like to thank Miss Bligh 
[02:26.73]for blowing out her slides.¡±
[02:28.62]W: Oh, no.
[02:29.92]M: I felt terrible. 
[02:31.66]I tried to apologize, 
[02:33.35]not very successfully.
[02:34.96]W: And the speech of thanks this evening?
[02:37.51]M: I¡¯ll write down exactly 
[02:38.94]what I¡¯m going to say and read it carefully.
[02:43.26]Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation 
[02:45.90]you have just heard.
[02:47.74]1. What is the man asked to do this evening?
[03:04.88]2. What do we learn about the man?
[03:21.20]3. What does the man say about Miss Bligh?
[03:38.28]4. What does the man say 
[03:40.91]about the first time he gave a speech of thanks?
[03:57.61]Conversation Two
[03:59.35]W: Another cup of tea, Paul?
[04:01.10]M: No, thanks. Well, what¡¯s new, Laury?
[04:04.15]W: Nothing dramatic. 
[04:05.46]But there is something you should know about.
[04:08.15]M: What¡¯s that?
[04:09.29]W: Well, 
[04:09.74]our rivals are offering extended credit terms
[04:12.54]to some of the retailers in the area.
[04:15.10]M: Oh? Which rival is this? 
[04:17.67]We only have two.
[04:18.87]W: Barratts Company.
[04:20.36]M: Oh, them. 
[04:21.49]Well, they are hardly a threat.
[04:23.47]W: I know they are smaller than us, 
[04:25.14]but we can¡¯t afford to ignore them.
[04:27.52]M: Yes, you are right, Laury. 
[04:29.24]But I don¡¯t like extended credit. 
[04:31.66]It ties up cash 
[04:32.99]we could put to better use elsewhere. 
[04:34.97]But, I¡¯ll look into it on Monday.
[04:37.41]W: Yes. And there is something else.
[04:39.90]M: Don¡¯t tell me! 
[04:41.39]The letter from the tax revenue office?
[04:43.50]W: Right. How did you know?
[04:45.45]M: Tara told me. What¡¯s the problem?
[04:48.29]W: Well. Tom got this letter late yesterday 
[04:51.34]and then went frantic
[04:52.89]trying to find copies of last year¡¯s accounts.
[04:56.36]M: Did he find them?
[04:57.62]W: No. And he was away 
[04:59.16]before I could get hold of the letter.
[05:01.73]M: How about a drive down to the office now? 
[05:04.27]And we¡¯ll see if everything¡¯s all right. 
[05:06.23]There¡¯s another reason 
[05:07.29]why I wanted a chat with you before Monday.
[05:09.73]W: I thought as much. 
[05:11.26]Well, go on, surprise me.
[05:14.18]M: How about selling 
[05:15.06]that new motorcycle of yours in Indonesia?
[05:18.15]W: What? You mean export? 
[05:20.68]Paul, I think you¡¯ve been away too long. 
[05:23.46]This is Jayal Motors. 
[05:25.62]We¡¯ve never sold a bike abroad.
[05:28.14]M: Don¡¯t worry, Laury. I¡¯m not crazy. 
[05:31.57]I¡¯ve been studying the possibility 
[05:33.48]and I think we should give it a go.
[05:35.57]W: It¡¯s not as easy as that though, is it? 
[05:38.05]We¡¯d have to reorganize the whole company.
[05:41.22]M: Don¡¯t be silly. 
[05:42.50]I don¡¯t intend starting next week. 
[05:45.23]We¡¯ll have to plan it properly. 
[05:47.07]Of course, there will be a few problems...
[05:48.68]W: A few problems? 
[05:50.17]I can see hundreds. 
[05:51.83]For one thing, transport. 
[05:54.14]I have enough trouble 
[05:55.29]delivering bikes to shops only 40 miles away, 
[05:58.45]never mind 5,000 miles!
[06:01.00]M: That¡¯s what forwarding agents are for.
[06:03.53]Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation 
[06:06.05]you have just heard.
[06:08.30]5. What does the woman think 
[06:11.01]the man should know?
[06:25.56]6. What does the woman think 
[06:28.29]of Barratts Company?
[06:42.95]7. What did the woman say
[06:45.91]about the letter from the tax revenue office?
[07:01.93]8. What is the man thinking of doing?
[07:18.54]Section B 
[07:19.66]Directions: In this section, 
[07:22.03]you will hear two passages. 
[07:24.06]At the end of each passage, 
[07:25.80]you will hear three or four questions. 
[07:28.58]Both the passage and the questions 
[07:31.19]will be spoken only once. 
[07:33.70]After you hear a question, 
[07:35.42]you must choose the best answer 
[07:37.36]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[07:42.30]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[07:44.57]on Answer Sheet 1 
[07:46.17]with a single line through the centre.
[07:49.51]Passage One
[07:51.27]A report on sleep and nutrition 
[07:53.81]released this month found that 
[07:55.66]people who consistently went to bed 
[07:57.49]earlier than 11 p.m. took in fewer calories 
[08:00.79]and ate more healthy food. 
[08:03.65]In contrast, ¡°night owls¡± who go to bed 
[08:06.94]between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. tend to 
[08:09.76]consume more coffee, alcohol, refined sugars 
[08:13.97]and processed meats than early risers.
[08:17.46]This report corresponds with 
[08:19.16]the existing scientific literature 
[08:20.85]on bedtime and wellness. 
[08:23.57]The relationship between getting more sleep 
[08:25.99]and making better food choices 
[08:27.92]is well-documented. 
[08:30.27]A study published last year 
[08:32.28]in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 
[08:34.74]found that people who sleep more 
[08:37.57]tend to eat less unhealthy food 
[08:39.93]than their peers who don¡¯t get as much rest. 
[08:43.10]And a 2015 study from 
[08:44.72]the University of California, Berkeley, 
[08:46.89]found that teens who go to bed late 
[08:49.26]are more likely to gain weight 
[08:50.99]over a five-year period.
[08:53.65]As a group, ¡°night owl¡± types 
[08:56.38]tend to eat less healthy food 
[08:58.36]and take in more calories overall 
[09:00.89]than early risers. 
[09:02.59]The later one goes to bed, 
[09:04.18]the more calories one records the next day. 
[09:07.80]As yet a challenge to explain 
[09:09.71]the cause-and-effect relationship 
[09:11.47]between sleep and nutrition, 
[09:13.60]there may be a third factor 
[09:15.10]that impacts both of them. 
[09:17.12]Or the relationship could be reversed, 
[09:19.48]that is, people who eat less fall asleep earlier. 
[09:23.43]Still, if late sleepers want to lose a few pounds, 
[09:27.54]they can go to bed earlier than they usually do, 
[09:30.40]thereby, reducing their chances of 
[09:32.28]taking snacks before bedtime.
[09:35.80]Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage 
[09:38.59]you have just heard.
[09:40.63]9. What do we learn about the report 
[09:44.03]released this month?
[09:58.24]10. What does the study from 
[10:00.72]the University of California, Berkeley, 
[10:03.40]find about teens who go to bed late?
[10:19.13]11. What should ¡°night owls¡± do 
[10:22.53]to reduce their consumption of unhealthy food?
[10:38.94]Passage Two
[10:40.54]Researchers have found 
[10:41.68]not just a diversity problem in Hollywood 
[10:44.69]but actually an inclusion crisis.
[10:47.87]With less than a week 
[10:49.50]before an Oscars ceremony 
[10:51.31]that has already been criticized 
[10:53.22]for an all-white list of acting nominees, 
[10:56.44]a study shows the film industry 
[10:58.80]does worse than television. 
[11:01.49]Just 3.4 percent of film directors were female, 
[11:05.39]and only 7 percent of films had a cast 
[11:08.93]whose balance of race and ethnicity 
[11:11.28]reflected the country¡¯s diversity. 
[11:14.56]When researchers looked at all TV shows, 
[11:17.63]they also found that women of color over 40 
[11:21.39]were regarded as ¡°largely invisible¡± 
[11:24.67]and just 22 percent of TV series creators 
[11:28.05]were female.
[11:29.83]Overall, the study found 
[11:31.65]half the films and TV shows 
[11:34.04]had no Asian speaking characters 
[11:37.01]and more than one-fifth of them 
[11:39.18]had no black characters with dialogue. 
[11:42.14]The film industry still functions as a straight, 
[11:45.47]white, boy¡¯s club. 
[11:47.42]When looking at how women are depicted, 
[11:50.12]the study found female characters 
[11:52.58]were four times more likely to be shown 
[11:55.13]in sexy clothing and nearly four times 
[11:58.47]as likely to be referred to 
[12:00.82]as physically attractive. 
[12:03.65]But their results also indicated 
[12:06.02]films and TV shows with women 
[12:08.68]or people of color in the important jobs 
[12:11.65]behind the scenes-director, producer or writer-
[12:15.04]tended to have better diversity numbers.
[12:18.63]Across TV and film, 
[12:20.96]the underrepresentation of non-white characters 
[12:24.23]falls mostly on Hispanics. 
[12:27.26]Among more than 10,000 characters, 
[12:29.90]proportions of white, black and Asian characters 
[12:33.42]came close to U.S. population figures. 
[12:36.90]But Hispanics were just 5.8 percent of characters, 
[12:41.73]despite being about 17 percent of the U.S. population.
[12:47.63]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage 
[12:50.83]you have just heard.
[12:53.33]12. Why has the Oscars ceremony been criticized?
[13:11.28]13. What do we learn from the research?
[13:28.92]14. Who are regarded as ¡°largely invisible¡± 
[13:34.17]on TV shows?
[13:49.14]15. What does the speaker say about Hispanics?
[14:06.48]Section C
[14:07.62]Directions: In this section, 
[14:10.05]you will hear three recordings of lectures or talks 
[14:13.27]followed by three or four questions. 
[14:16.38]The recordings will be played only once. 
[14:19.81]After you hear a question, 
[14:21.43]you must choose the best answer 
[14:22.99]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). 
[14:27.98]Then mark the corresponding letter 
[14:30.30]on Answer Sheet 1 
[14:32.11]with a single line through the centre.
[14:35.35]Recording One
[14:36.87]When purchasing life insurance, 
[14:38.90]there are many important factors to consider. 
[14:41.84]One should buy the policies 
[14:43.71]that give the most protection at the least cost, 
[14:46.69]ensure the right family members, 
[14:48.94]and consider the family¡¯s financial needs. 
[14:52.21]It is important to buy the insurance 
[14:53.99]from companies that are financially sound 
[14:56.33]and that are represented by honest, 
[14:58.15]well-trained agents. 
[15:00.42]At various stages in a person¡¯s life, 
[15:03.40]different kinds of life insurance 
[15:04.96]are needed for particular situations.
[15:08.05]Jerry is single and has no dependents. 
[15:11.75]Probably the only life insurance he needs 
[15:14.22]is enough to cover his debts 
[15:15.53]and burial expenses. 
[15:17.64]Insurance can be purchased at a lower rate 
[15:19.68]during the young years, 
[15:21.15]but by buying while young, 
[15:23.42]the premiums are paid in 
[15:24.56]for a longer period of time. 
[15:26.74]In the end, 
[15:27.99]the amount paid for premiums
[15:29.30]is about the same. 
[15:30.95]A person shouldn¡¯t buy insurance protection 
[15:33.07]that really isn¡¯t necessary. 
[15:35.39]Suppose that Jerry marries Jeannette, 
[15:37.37]who is a college graduate and is working. 
[15:40.03]Perhaps enough insurance would be needed 
[15:41.87]to cover their debts and burial expenses. 
[15:45.22]Now, Jeannette has quit work 
[15:47.67]and their first child is on the way. 
[15:49.92]They have purchased a home 
[15:51.37]with a small down payment 
[15:52.85]and a 30-year mortgage. 
[15:55.03]The situation regarding life insurance 
[15:56.99]takes on a different look. 
[15:58.78]There are dependents 
[15:59.60]who need financial protection. 
[16:02.04]How much insurance is needed? 
[16:04.12]As the family increases in size, 
[16:06.43]it is essential to add more insurance 
[16:08.31]on the breadwinner to protect the dependents. 
[16:11.33]When the children are young 
[16:13.36]and depend upon the family for financial needs, 
[16:16.59]families with modest incomes have difficulty 
[16:19.12]providing enough life insurance 
[16:20.63]to protect the mother and the children. 
[16:23.55]Families with modest incomes 
[16:25.30]should insure the breadwinner 
[16:27.07]or breadwinners first. 
[16:29.20]When considering the amount of insurance 
[16:31.16]for the mother with dependent children, 
[16:34.33]substitute child care is a need 
[16:37.11]that should be planned for 
[16:38.86]until the children can care for themselves. 
[16:42.24]The death of a small child 
[16:43.95]would have no effect upon 
[16:45.51]the income of the family. 
[16:47.72]Perhaps a policy to meet funeral expenses
[16:50.94]would be sufficient for the young child, 
[16:53.60]although most people do not take out insurance 
[16:55.92]on their young children. 
[16:58.09]As the children become 
[16:59.20]financially independent of the family, 
[17:02.02]the emphasis on family financial security 
[17:04.78]will shift from protection 
[17:06.71]to saving for the retirement years. 
[17:10.66]Every family situation is different, 
[17:13.19]but it is important that
[17:14.73]each family give adequate thought 
[17:17.16]to planning its financial future.
[17:20.07]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the recording 
[17:22.93]you have just heard.
[17:25.18]16. What life insurance should a single person buy, 
[17:30.52]according to the speaker?
[17:44.98]17. What should people do 
[17:47.90]as their family increases in size?
[18:04.04]18. When should one change their life insurance?
[18:22.20]Recording Two
[18:24.06] ¡°Stereotype¡± may sound like a bad word, 
[18:27.34]but there¡¯s nothing bad about it. 
[18:29.87]For one thing, stereotypes are often accurate. 
[18:34.01]When you ask people 
[18:35.07]about their concept of stereotypes, 
[18:37.79]they get it pretty much right. 
[18:40.26]Also, stereotypes are often positive, 
[18:44.09]particularly of groups 
[18:45.48]that we ourselves belong to. 
[18:48.12]Some of the statistical generalizations 
[18:50.97]may be positive as some groups have reputations 
[18:54.53]for being smart, for being loyal, for being brave, 
[18:59.35]for all sorts of things that are not at all negative. 
[19:03.11]And so there¡¯s nothing inherently wrong
[19:05.68]about stereotypes.
[19:07.92]But there are problems with stereotypes. 
[19:11.37]For one thing, 
[19:12.49]they¡¯re reliable insofar 
[19:14.34]as they¡¯re based on unbiased samples.
[19:17.65]But a lot of the information 
[19:20.19]we get about human groups
[19:22.17]is through biased sources 
[19:24.62]like how they¡¯re represented in the media. 
[19:28.03]And if these sources 
[19:29.75]don¡¯t give you an accurate depiction,
[19:32.30]your stereotype won¡¯t be accurate.
[19:35.46]For example, 
[19:36.87]many Jews have been troubled by 
[19:39.00]Shakespeare¡¯s depiction of Shylock. 
[19:41.61]If the only Jew you know 
[19:43.46]is Shakespeare¡¯s Shylock, 
[19:45.05]it¡¯s going to be a very bad impression. 
[19:48.29]So one problem with stereotypes is 
[19:50.91]while we are good at drawing conclusions from them,
[19:53.88]often our information isn¡¯t reliable.
[19:58.02]A second problem is that stereotypes, 
[20:01.03]regardless of whether or not they¡¯re accurate, 
[20:03.88]can have a negative effect on the people 
[20:06.37]that they apply to. 
[20:08.48]And this is what psychologist, 
[20:10.01]Claude Steele, described as stereotype threat. 
[20:14.53]He has a vivid example of this. 
[20:17.94]Here¡¯s how to make African-Americans
[20:20.21]do worse on a math test. 
[20:22.94]You have the test and you put on the test 
[20:25.99]that they have to identify their race. 
[20:29.42]The very act of acknowledging that 
[20:31.32]they are African-Americans 
[20:33.43]when given a test ignites in them 
[20:36.04]thoughts of their own stereotype 
[20:38.42]which is negative regarding academics 
[20:41.36]and that makes them do worse. 
[20:44.48]Want to know how to make a woman do worse 
[20:46.85]on a math test? 
[20:48.47]Same thing, get her to write down her sex.
[20:52.85]One recent study found a sort of clever twist on this. 
[20:57.28]When Asian-American women are given a test 
[21:00.71]and they¡¯re asked to mark down their race,
[21:02.97]they do better than they would otherwise do. 
[21:06.81]They¡¯re reminded of a positive stereotype 
[21:09.49]that boosts their morale. 
[21:11.62]You ask them, on the other hand, 
[21:14.26]to mark down their sex, they do worse 
[21:17.72]because they¡¯re reminded of 
[21:18.92]a negative stereotype. 
[21:21.66]That¡¯s an example of how stereotypes 
[21:23.85]have a potentially damaging effect on people.
[21:29.56]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the recording 
[21:33.73]you have just heard.
[21:36.20]19. What does the speaker say about stereotypes?
[21:54.99]20. What leads to the bias of stereotypes?
[22:13.61]21. What does the speaker say 
[22:16.40]is a problem with stereotypes?
[22:32.41]22. What did one recent study find about stereotypes?
[22:52.25]Recording Three
[22:54.65]Sometimes when you take a common drug, 
[22:57.50]you may have a side effect. 
[22:59.65]That is, the drug may cause some effect 
[23:03.59]other than its intended one. 
[23:05.79]When these side effects occur, 
[23:07.82]they are called adverse reactions. 
[23:11.22]Whenever you have an adverse reaction, 
[23:13.58]you should stop taking the drug right away. 
[23:16.48]Ask your pharmacist 
[23:17.90]whether he can suggest a drug 
[23:19.51]that will relieve the symptoms 
[23:21.44]but that will not cause the adverse reaction. 
[23:25.02]If an adverse reaction to a drug is serious, 
[23:28.27]consult your doctor for advice at once.
[23:31.54]Drugs that are safe in the dosage 
[23:33.88]stated on the label 
[23:35.43]may be very dangerous in large doses. 
[23:38.46]For example, 
[23:40.24]aspirin is seldom thought of as dangerous, 
[23:43.19]but there are many reports of 
[23:44.73]accidental poisoning of young children 
[23:47.47]who take too many aspirin pills 
[23:49.97]as well as the possible development 
[23:51.99]of Reye syndrome in children with flu. 
[23:56.03]In adults, 
[23:57.25]excessive use of some pain-killing drugs 
[23:59.66]may cause severe kidney damage. 
[24:02.95]Some drugs for relief of stomach upsets, 
[24:05.75]when taken in excess, 
[24:07.75]can perhaps cause serious digestive problems. 
[24:11.51]You should never use any over-the-counter drug 
[24:14.53]on a regular, continued basis, 
[24:16.97]or in large quantities, 
[24:19.01]except on your doctor¡¯s advice. 
[24:21.94]You could be suffering from a serious illness 
[24:24.18]that needs a doctor¡¯s care.
[24:27.14]Each drug you take not only acts on the body 
[24:30.57]but may also alter the effect 
[24:32.31]of any other drug you are taking. 
[24:35.10]Sometimes this can cause dangerous 
[24:37.20]or even fatal reactions. 
[24:40.05]For example, 
[24:41.88]aspirin increases the blood-thinning effects 
[24:45.13]of drugs given to patients with heart disease. 
[24:48.57]Therefore, a patient 
[24:50.68]who has been taking such a drug 
[24:52.52]may risk bleeding 
[24:54.07]if he or she uses aspirin for a headache. 
[24:58.42]Before using several drugs together 
[25:01.05]you should ask your doctor 
[25:02.41]and follow his advice. 
[25:04.85]Your pharmacist can tell you 
[25:06.22]whether certain drugs can safely be taken together.
[25:10.49]Alcohol may increase the effect of a drug-
[25:15.41]sleeping pills combine with alcohol 
[25:17.72]to produce a sleepy feeling. 
[25:20.47]When taking any drug, 
[25:22.16]you should ask your doctor 
[25:23.80]whether drinking alcohol could be dangerous 
[25:26.81]in combination with the medicine.
[25:29.85]Experts believe there is a relationship 
[25:32.38]between adult abuse of legitimate medicines 
[25:35.62]and the drug culture that has swept our country. 
[25:39.48]You can do your share to reduce the chances 
[25:42.90]that your children will become 
[25:44.35]part of the drug culture 
[25:46.59]by treating all medicines with respect. 
[25:49.96]Always let your children know that 
[25:52.05]medicines and drugs should not be used carelessly.
[25:57.10]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the recording 
[26:00.78]you have just heard.
[26:03.01]23. What does the speaker say you should do 
[26:07.09]when you have an adverse reaction?
[26:22.11]24. What does the speaker say 
[26:25.30]about alcohol drinking?
[26:40.24]25. What does the speaker call on parents to do 
[26:45.24]at the end of the talk?
[27:00.94]This is the end of listening comprehension.
